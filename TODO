----

all:
1. popt-ify all programs.


yapp_ft:
1.  BUG: Support non-default number of taps.
2.  FEATURE: Support single-pol. data.
3.  FEATURE: Plot in 2D


yapp_viewdata:
1.  BUG: Signal-handling in non-interactive mode causes blocking in cpgclos()
    and crash on kill.
2.  BUG:
    plotraw -b 62334 a14aa899.spec
    Anything above 62334 (out of 62385) is nan (problem maybe with
    das_spectro_lin).
3.  BUG: In YAPP_ReadData(), take malloc() outside.
4.  BUG: Last block of 0833b45.spec not plotting correctly.
5.  BUG: crash in reading 4bit data
6.  BUG: Process exactly the amount of time asked for, not at multiples of
    block size.
7.  FEATURE: Support user-defined colourmaps.


yapp_dedisp:
1.  BUG: if file name is fake.fil, output is fak.tim or fak.dds
2.  BUG: dedisp: Negative DM dedispersion not correct.


All:
1.  FEATURE: Add block X of Y in plots.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yapp_dedisperse:
1.  BUG: yapp_dedisperse not working properly.
2.  BUG:
    sps_dedisperse -N 2 -X 2 -n 3 -x 4 -p 10 -o a14aa899.spec
    For small processing percentages, crash at fclose(pFSpec) and at
    free(g_pfDedispData) when doing ^C.
3.  BUG: First block's shifted data to be written to the file.
4.  BUG: the first ~160 bytes in each of DM channels in the first block don't
    match, across different block sizes
5.  BUG: Linear delays don't match that calculated by 'other law'. Work around
    in place.
6.  BUG: Program crashes when one of the law limits is 0 or too large for a
    double to contain the factor.
7.  BUG: Delays calculated for laws < 1.0 are not correct.
8.  FEATURE: Compare max SNRs between laws and write only max to file.

Misc:
1.  FEATURE: Program to update the old-format field name (NXXXX) with the new
    format (JXXXX+YY)
2.  BUG (PGPLOT BUG): PGPLOT leaks 26 bytes just be cpgopen() and cpgclos().

Bugs in Other Programs:
1. psrfits2psrfits: Creation of 4-bit files from 16-bit files seems to cause
   header to be corrupted. File unreadable from yapp_viewmetadata, header,
   readfile.
