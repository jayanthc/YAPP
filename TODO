yapp_viewmetadata:
1.  FEATURE: Handle the headerless/header-separated filterbank format input.

yapp_viewdata:
1.  BUG: Signal-handling in non-interactive mode causes blocking in cpgclos()
    and crash on kill.
2.  BUG: Crash in:
    yapp_viewdata -P 10 ../ort/0833b45.spec
3.  BUG: For block size < 1024, bytes to skip not happening at multiple of
    block size.
4.  BUG:
    plotraw -b 62334 a14aa899.spec
    Anything above 62334 (out of 62385) is nan (problem maybe with
    das_spectro_lin).
5.  i. BUG: data skip: --data-skip-percent and --data-skip-time doesn't behave
    in the same way, for low amounts of data.
    ii. Block 2 for sps -n <min> -x <max> -p 20 -b <x> <file> and block 1 for
    sps -n <min> -x <max> -s 10 -p 20 -b <x> <file> does not seem to be the
    same. this is true for time mode too.
6.  BUG: Eliminte flickering in noninteractive mode plots by redrawing only
    axes.
7.  FEATURE: Support user-defined colourmaps.
8.  FEATURE: Exit button.

yapp_dedisp:
1.  BUG: *.tim files created by yapp_dedisp for *.fil does not result in pulsar
    detection using seek+best.
2.  BUG: *.tim files created by yapp_dedisp for 0833b45.spec not working with
    seek+best.
3.  BUG: dedisp: Negative DM dedispersion not correct.

yapp_dedisperse:
1.  BUG: yapp_dedisperse not working properly.
2.  BUG:
    sps_dedisperse -N 2 -X 2 -n 3 -x 4 -p 10 -o a14aa899.spec
    For small processing percentages, crash at fclose(pFSpec) and at
    free(g_pfDedispData) when doing ^C.
3.  BUG: First block's shifted data to be written to the file.
4.  BUG: the first ~160 bytes in each of DM channels in the first block don't
    match, across different block sizes
5.  BUG: Linear delays don't match that calculated by 'other law'. Work around
    in place.
6.  BUG: Program crashes when one of the law limits is 0 or too large for a
    double to contain the factor.
7.  BUG: Delays calculated for laws < 1.0 are not correct.
8.  FEATURE: Compare max SNRs between laws and write only max to file.

Misc:
1.  FEATURE: Program to update the old-format field name (NXXXX) with the new
    format (JXXXX+YY)
2.  BUG (PGPLOT BUG): PGPLOT leaks 26 bytes just be cpgopen() and cpgclos().
