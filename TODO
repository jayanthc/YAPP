----


1. RFI mask generator.
2. yapp equivalent to realfft.
3. Barycentre based on location of observatory.


all:
1. popt-ify all programs.


yapp_add:
1.  FEATURE: Wildcards - automatically decide right order.


yapp_ft:
1.  FEATURE: Support single-pol. data.
2.  FEATURE: Plot in 2D
3.  FEATURE: Add GPU acceleration.
4.  FEATURE: Add time series Fourier transform.


yapp_viewdata:
1.  BUG: Skipping bug.
2.  BUG: For .spec files, when processing a certain percentage of data, the
    gain, clipping, etc. is done even for trailing zeroes.
3.  BUG: Clipping doesn't seem to happen as expected.
4.  BUG: Signal-handling in non-interactive mode causes blocking in cpgclos()
    and crash on kill.
5.  BUG:
    plotraw -b 62334 a14aa899.spec
    Anything above 62334 (out of 62385) is nan (problem maybe with
    das_spectro_lin).
6.  BUG: Last block of 0833b45.spec not plotting correctly.
8.  FEATURE: Support user-defined colourmaps.


yapp_dedisperse:
1.  BUG: Doesn't dedisperse merged files properly.
2.  BUG: Negative DM dedispersion not correct.
3.  BUG: When creating .fil output files, last block leaves some remnant stuff.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yapp_dedisplaw:
1.  BUG: yapp_dedisperse not working properly.
2.  BUG:
    sps_dedisperse -N 2 -X 2 -n 3 -x 4 -p 10 -o a14aa899.spec
    For small processing percentages, crash at fclose(pFSpec) and at
    free(g_pfDedispData) when doing ^C.
3.  BUG: First block's shifted data to be written to the file.
4.  BUG: the first ~160 bytes in each of DM channels in the first block don't
    match, across different block sizes
5.  BUG: Linear delays don't match that calculated by 'other law'. Work around
    in place.
6.  BUG: Program crashes when one of the law limits is 0 or too large for a
    double to contain the factor.
7.  BUG: Delays calculated for laws < 1.0 are not correct.
8.  FEATURE: Compare max SNRs between laws and write only max to file.

Misc:
2.  BUG (PGPLOT BUG): PGPLOT leaks 124 bytes just by cpgopen() and cpgclos().

Bugs in Other Programs:
1. psrfits2psrfits: Creation of 4-bit files from 16-bit files seems to cause
   header to be corrupted. File unreadable from yapp_viewmetadata, header,
   readfile.
