1.  BUG: Crash in:
    yapp_viewdata -P 10 ../ort/0833b45.spec
2.  BUG: For block size < 1024, bytes to skip not happening at multiple of
    block size.
3.  BUG: *.tim files created by yapp_dedisp for *.fil does not result in pulsar
    detection using seek+best.
4.  BUG: *.tim files created by yapp_dedisp for 0833b45.spec not working with
    seek+best.
5.  yapp_dedisperse not working properly.
6.  sps_dedisperse -N 2 -X 2 -n 3 -x 4 -p 10 -o a14aa899.spec
    For small processing percentages, crash at fclose(pFSpec) and at
    free(g_pfDedispData) when doing ^C.
7.  plotraw -b 62334 a14aa899.spec
    Anything above 62334 (out of 62385) is nan (problem maybe with
    das_spectro_lin).
8.  i. BUG: data skip: --data-skip-percent and --data-skip-time doesn't behave
    in the same way, for low amounts of data.
    ii. Block 2 for sps -n <min> -x <max> -p 20 -b <x> <file> and block 1 for
    sps -n <min> -x <max> -s 10 -p 20 -b <x> <file> does not seem to be the
    same. this is true for time mode too.
9.  yapp_dedisperse: First block's shifted data to be written to the file.
10. BUG: the first ~160 bytes in each of DM channels in the first block don't
    match, across different block sizes
11. Compare max SNRs between laws and write only max to file.
12. Program to update the old-format field name (NXXXX) with the new
    format (JXXXX+YY)
13. Linear delays don't match that calculated by 'other law'. Work around in
    place.
14. BUG: Program crashes when one of the law limits is 0 or too large for a
    double to contain the factor.
15. BUG: Delays calculated for laws < 1.0 are not correct.
16. BUG: dedisp: Negative DM dedispersion not correct.
17. Handle the headerless/header-separated filterbank format input.
