Yet Another Pulsar Processor (YAPP) 3.4-beta
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README


Yet Another Pulsar Processor (YAPP) is a suite of radio pulsar data analysis
software.

The YAPP tools available with this release are:

    yapp_viewmetadata   : Prints metadata/data header/configuration information
                          to standard output.
    yapp_viewdata       : Plots data to PGPLOT device.
    yapp_ft             : Performs [PFB +] FFT on 8-bit, complex, dual-pol.
                          baseband data.
    yapp_dedisperse     : Dedisperses filterbank format data.
    yapp_smooth         : Boxcar-smoothes dedispersed time series data
    yapp_filter         : Processes dedispersed time series data with a custom
                          frequency-domain filter.
    yapp_add            : Coherently add dedispersed time series data from
                          multiple frequency bands
    yapp_fold           : Folds filterbank and dedispersed time series data.
    yapp_subtract       : Subtracts two dedispersed time series files.
    yapp_siftpulses     : Sifts multiple dedispersed time series files for
                          bright pulses.
    yapp_stacktim       : Stacks time series data to form filterbank data.

YAPP also comes with the following utilities:

    yapp_fits2fil       : Converts PSRFITS data to SIGPROC '.fil'
    yapp_dat2tim        : Converts PRESTO '.dat' to SIGPROC '.tim'
    yapp_tim2dat        : Converts SIGPROC '.tim' to PRESTO '.dat'

YAPP includes the following scripts:

    yapp_genpfbcoeff.py     : Generate PFB co-efficients for yapp_ft.
    yapp_genfiltermask.py   : Generate filter response for yapp_filter.
    yapp_calcspecidx.py     : Calculate spectral index from a sequence of time
                              series files corresponding to multiple bands.
    yapp_stackprof.py       : Stacks folded profiles from multiple bands to
                              show a plot of phase versus frequency.
    yapp_addprof.py         : Add [calibrated] profiles from two polarisations.

The supported file formats are are DAS '.spec', SIGPROC '.fil', and SIGPROC
'.tim', with limited support for DAS '.dds', PSRFITS, and PRESTO '.dat'.

For detailed usage instructions, refer the man pages and/or online
documentation.

System requirements: Linux/Mac OS, PGPLOT with C binding, FFTW3, CFITSIO,
Python with Matplotlib

Installation instructions: On a typical Ubuntu-based machine in which PGPLOT,
FFTW3, and CFITSIO were installed via APT, running 'make' followed by
'sudo make install' should work, with the binaries being copied to
/usr/local/bin. For different operating systems and/or different
PGPLOT/FFTW3/CFITSIO installation directories and/or a different choice of YAPP
installation directory, the makefile may need to be modified by hand.
