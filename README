Yet Another Pulsar Processor (YAPP) 3.0-beta
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README


Yet Another Pulsar Processor (YAPP) is a suite of radio pulsar data analysis
software.

The YAPP tools available with this release are:

    yapp_viewmetadata   : Prints metadata/data header/configuration information
                          to standard output.
    yapp_viewdata       : Plots data to PGPLOT device.
    yapp_ft             : Performs [PFB +] FFT on 8-bit, complex, dual-pol.
                          baseband data.
    yapp_dedisperse     : Dedisperses filterbank format data.
    yapp_smooth         : Boxcar-smoothes dedispersed time series data
    yapp_filter         : Processes dedispersed time series data with a custom
                          frequency-domain filter. 
    yapp_fold           : Folds filterbank and dedispersed time series data and
                          plots folded profile to PGPLOT device.

YAPP also comes with the following utilities:

    yapp_fits2fil       : Converts PSRFITS data to SIGPROC '.fil'
    yapp_dat2tim        : Converts PRESTO '.dat' to SIGPROC '.tim'

The supported file formats are are DAS '.spec', SIGPROC '.fil', and SIGPROC
'.tim', with partial support for PSRFITS and PRESTO '.dat'.

For detailed usage instructions, refer the man pages and/or online
documentation.

System requirements: Linux/Mac OS, PGPLOT with C binding, FFTW3, CFITSIO

Installation instructions: On a typical Ubuntu-based machine in which PGPLOT
was installed via APT, running 'make' followed by 'sudo make install' should
work, with the binaries being copied to /usr/local/bin. For different operating
systems and/or different PGPLOT/FFTW3/CFITSIO installation directories and/or a
different choice of YAPP installation directory, the makefile may need to be
modified by hand.
