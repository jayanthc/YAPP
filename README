-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
README


Yet Another Pulsar Processor (YAPP) is a suite of radio pulsar data analysis
software.

The YAPP tools available with this release are:

    yapp_viewmetadata   : Prints metadata/data header/configuration information
                          to standard output.
    yapp_viewdata       : Plots raw dynamic spectrum data to PGPLOT device.
    yapp_ft             : Performs FFT [+ PFB] on 8-bit, complex, dual-pol.
                          baseband data.
    yapp_dedisperse     : Dedisperses filterbank format data.
    yapp_smooth         : Boxcar-smoothes dedispersed time series data

The supported file formats for both tools are DAS '.spec' and SIGPROC '.fil'.

System requirements: Linux/Mac OS, PGPLOT with C binding

Installation instructions: On a typical Ubuntu-based machine in which PGPLOT
was installed via APT, running 'make' followed by 'sudo make install' should
work, with the binaries being copied to /usr/local/bin. For different operating
systems and/or different PGPLOT installation directories and/or a different
choice of YAPP installation directory, the makefile may need to be modified by
hand.
